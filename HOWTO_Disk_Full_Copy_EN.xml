 <h1>How to do a disk full copy</h1>

To make a fully copy of a disk (including MBR) :

1) Put the target and the source disk on the same machine 

2) Boot with a live Os

3) Be Sure to know what is the source disk and what is the target disk
   This command can help you :
   <shell>sudo fdisk -l</shell>

4) then you can copy 
   <shell>sudo dd if=/dev/sdXXX of=/dev/sdXXX</shell>
   by replacing "XXX" by the letter of your disk
