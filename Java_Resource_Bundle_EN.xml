<h1>How to load a resource bundle from a properties file in Java ?</h1>

There are two ways of loading the resource bundle depending if the properties file is located in the classpath or not.

<h2>Location in classpath</h2>
Put your properties file into a jar and add it to your classpath.
Check that your file has the correct "properties" extension : "myBundle.properties" for example.
You then load the bundle and get the property using this code :

<code type="java">
	final ResourceBundle resourceBundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle("myBundle");
	final String myProperty = resourceBundle.getString("property_key");
</code>
	
<h2>Location outside of classpath</h2>
In this case your file will be placed in an external folder, for example "C:\\temp", so it won't be placed in the classpath.
You may still check that it has the correct "properties" extension.
You load the bundle and get the property using this code :

<code type="java">
	final File file = new File("C:\\temp");
	final URL[] urls = {file.toURI().toURL()};
	final ClassLoader classLoader = new URLClassLoader(urls);
	final ResourceBundle resourceBundle = ResourceBundle.getBundle("myBundle", Locale.getDefault(), loader);
	final String myProperty = resourceBundle.getString("property_key");
</code>

Note that "myBundle" relates to myBundle.properties, myBundle_en_US.properties, etc.
