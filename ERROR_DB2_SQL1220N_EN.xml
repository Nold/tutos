	<h1>Error DB2 SQL1220N</h1>

Error message :
SQL1220N  The database manager shared memory set cannot be allocated.

The system hasn't enough memory relatively to the configured value.

Correction :
In the file ./sqllib/db2dump/db2diag.log, you can see the error :
<code type="txt">
     INSTANCE_MEMORY setting of YYYYYY cannot exceed physical memory limit of XXXXXX
</code>

You just have to lower the value with :
<shell>db2 update dbm cfg using instance_memory XXXXXX</shell>
