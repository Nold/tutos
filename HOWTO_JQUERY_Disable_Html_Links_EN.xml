 <h1>How to disable all links in a web page with JQuery ?</h1>

This tutorial with show you how to disable all the links in a web page, with a very simple JQuery code.
What's the point of disabling all links anyway ?
Well there can be many reasons to do so, here we are going to consider that the links should not be clickable until the page is fully loaded.
In recent browsers, the HTML elements are displayed while processed by the browser and some links can appear way before the rest of the page.
Let's say our application wants to prevent link clicks during page loading.
We are going to use JQuery for that purpose.

1) Install JQuery
If your application does not already use JQuery, you must download the JQuery file and declare it in your pages.
JQuery can be downloaded <link src="">here</link>.
Place it in your application, maybe in a "javascripts" directory, and then simply declare it in your page : 
<code type="html">
	<script src="javascripts/jquery1.9.1.js"></script>
</code>

2) Declare the JQuery script 
Insert the following script in your html page :
<code type="html">
	<script type="javascript">
		var isPageLoaded=false;
	
		$("a, input").click(function(){
		    if(!isPageLoaded){
			return false;
		    }
		});

		addEvent(window,'load', function() {
			// enabling the clicks when the page is fully loaded
			isPageLoaded=true;
		});
	</script>
</code>

You noted that two types of links have been disabled : the simple "a" links and the "input" ones.
If the page is no yet loaded, the function associated to thoses elements returns false, meaning a click on those won't actualy do anything.
Then an event is declared to enable back the links when the page is fully loaded.
Simple enough ?

There is a drawback to this method however : if your page load stalls because of say, a server problem, then the links will never be activated...
